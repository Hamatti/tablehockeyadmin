<h1> TableHockeyAdminTool (THAT) - Vaadin application for organising Table Hockey Leagues </h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

I've played <a href="http://www.ithf.info/stiga/ithf/index.aspx">table hockey</a> since 2003 and it has been one of my original reasons for starting programming. There were some tools for dealing with single tournaments like FTHA's and Ismo Aulaskari's peli2.jar with which this application is compatible. Handling multiple leagues with dozens of tournaments per season definitely needs good tools and as a part of the ongoing website renewing, I created THAT to avoid using commandline scripts and give non-technical people in our community the possibility to do it by themselves.

I also wanted to learn Vaadin web framework and this project was done on Nottingham Code Camp in 48 hours in February 2013.

<h2> Features </h2>

THAT is compatible with the tournament tool that Finnish Table Hockey Association uses and you can upload .tnmt files created with peli2.jar and THAT parses the file, counts correct statistics, updates database tables and shows the current situation on the application. It's also very convenient to show that data on a normal web page for users who are not admins.
